# CS231n_ConvolutionalNetworks
This repository includes the assignments to the Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition class (CS231n) from Stanford. Everything concerning this class is available online. Here is the link: http://cs231n.github.io/

The assignments are a good way to get into the details of how neural networks are built, an insight that might not be possible with excellent tools as Theano, TensorFlow, Keras and others.
